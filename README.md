# poll-app-tutorial
Simple poll-app I made following the Django tutorial, added a chart builder API (zingchart) to show visual representation of the results.

In the command line of and empty folder type:

1: git clone https://github.com/ManelGonzalez-ops/poll-app-tutorial.git

-Once the files are in your the local system, type again:

2:  pipenv shell

3:  cd poll-app

4:  python manage.py runserver

  - at this point project will open at localhost port 8000
  
5:  You have a django admin at localhost:8000/admin where you can easily add new polls.
